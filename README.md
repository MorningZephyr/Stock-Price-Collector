# Stock Price Collector

This project is a stock price collector, built around a library called yfinance. After a user enters a stock ticker symbol, they have the options to select how far back the data should include, as well as the time intervals between each stock price data. The data will then be downloaded to the current directory at which this code resides, and a graph will also be generated. The following breaks down each of the functions in the project

## Roadmap:

Currently designing the frontend for the project using Next.js, with Flask being the backend. See the respectivbe folders for progress. The main functionality for the backend is complete, now awaiting for routing!
