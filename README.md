# Stock Price Collector

This project is a stock price collector, built around a library called yfinance. After a user enters a stock ticker symbol, they have the options to select how far back the data should include, as well as the time intervals between each stock price data. The data will then be downloaded, and a graph will also be generated. The terminal version of the application is available in respective folders while the web version is currently being developed.

- Frontend: Next.js
- Backend: Python and Flask
